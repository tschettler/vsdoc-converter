# vsdoc-converter
Converts vsdoc comments to jsdoc.

## Synopsis

A library to parse VSDoc comments to JSDoc.

## Code Example

<code>
VSDocConverter.exe [.js file path or directory] 
</code>

Work in progress.

## Motivation

I wrote this because I was unable to find a library that could fully convert VSDoc comments to JSDoc. Ultimately, I didn't want to maintain two different sets of JavaScript documentation.

## Installation

Build and execute.

## API Reference

For now, the README will be the API reference.

## Tests

Tests still under development.

## Contributors

I'm happy to take pull requests, suggestions, and ideas.

## License

This library is released under The MIT License (MIT).

## TODO

* Project rename
* Split into multiple projects (API, Console)
* Add unit tests
* Consider changing convert to return a list of strings (handle comment formatting separately)
* Split up FileParser
